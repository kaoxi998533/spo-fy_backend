In the 80s they appeared at the 1st Leeds Futurama Festival and were briefly grouped with the Futurists, sharing live bills alongside fledgling electro-poppers Depeche Mode and chanteuse Marc Almond. The division of live audiences into Blah haters and Blah lovers, often caused near-riots. They eventually retired from the limelight following an attempted live arson attack on band members by a nice fellow in the audience at their thirteenth gig in Stevenage. If you mixed The Residents with the Bonzo Dog Doodah Band and Captain Beefheart you might end up with Blah Blah Blah – whimsical, weird and totally barmy.  The influence of nursery rhymes, sea-shanties, trash literature and TV, and instruments sounding like something that’s escaped from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.</p>", "image_file": "https://freemusicarchive.org/file/images/artists/Blah_Blah_Blah_-_2013051352105117.jpg", "location": "Colchester UK", "name": "Blah Blah Blah"}}, {"model": "myapp.artist", "pk": 86, "fields": {"bio": null, "image_file": "https://freemusicarchive.org/img/generic/album-default-live.png", "location": null, "name": "Blanketship"}}, {"model": "myapp.artist", "pk": 89, "fields": {"bio": "<p>Boogie Witch featured members of the Strapping Fieldhands.

It defies belief but I present it to you as truth in this condensed form. He is a being from another time and another place; a place not of this Earth but another world.In that world, Borful Tang was one of the legendary hill herders and a musician of great renown. Hill herding was a mysterious profession, the art known only to a few, passed down from master to apprentice. He shepherded the hills from one region to another across the vast plains of the world, communicating and moving them through sound.In his rambling home atop one of the larger hills, he crafted instruments that produced huge complex swathes of sound. Some of them resembled the giant horns used by the Tibetans in our world, while others were large, intricate wooden contraptions capable of playing repeated, interweaving patterns. Borful would send forth mighty volleys of drones and cascading notes, and the hills would lift slowly up with a great cracking of stone and earth. As a hill shuffled onward, another would come in and settle on the abandoned ground. In this slow, stately manner he roamed the plains with his flock.More socially minded than the traditional hill herder,  Borful would often look in on the towns and cities that existed on the edges of the great plains and listen to their different musics. As he absorbed the sounds from these disparate cultures, he became intrigued with the idea of performance and composition. He combined these new ideas and melodies with elements of his hill sound, creating a uniquely powerful music. He began performing this music and so his legend grew.However, there was great turmoil coming to the world. At the height of his fame, a group of lords in league with dark forces of great mystical power, splintered off from the democratic governing body and took control of that world in a violent coup. They opened a portal between their world and ours here on Earth. Undetected by the governing bodies of our planet, they used the Slave Birds to capture humans and bring them back through the portal to work in their immense ore mines. They grew rich and powerful, ruling their world with a ruthless single-minded quest for power.The lords knew the legend of the hill herders and that of Borful Tang. They wanted control of the ancient hills for themselves but Borful alone, resisted. With some renegade human slaves, he took the hills into battle against the lords, but their power was too great. He was forced to retreat, only to be caught by the Slave Birds and brought through the portal to Earth.Borful Tang remains here in exile, his life as a hill herder snatched away. He finds solace in his music. He cannot craft the instruments he once played with the available materials on our world. but he has learned how to utilize the technology of our time to at least continue his musical path.There is far more to this tale than can be explained in this brief text. As he reveals his story to me, so I shall share it with you.

I noise, in my quiet way, to speak the twisted and skewed, fully utterable at the moment we dare to say what has been feared or forbidden.<br /> As this neither woman nor musician, or both at once, I find my better self against fixity and commodity, loathing the marketing of the intimacy of personal space, a demand for the performer&rsquo;s sexuality or personality, the gaze that coats living, changing, morphing tissue and fluid with the suffocating synthetics of expectation, projection, and other desires that form the violent refuse disowned by the normal world. (Trauma is not for oggling.) <br /><br /> I cannot just yet call music &ldquo;work.&rdquo; For &ldquo;work&rdquo; in the corporate US is only ever mechanical reproduction. Only productivity is rewarded: (how many &ldquo;records have you sold?&rdquo;) When I view music as work, in this everywhere definition, it loses its intimacy, and becomes something empty and exhausting.<br /> Nor can I easily call music &ldquo;property.&rdquo; For property involves nervously guarding, and desiring isolation. I have never dreamed of a cash cow or a Mercedes. I do not wish to join the propertied class, so that someday I turn and look upon a bandmate as a &ldquo;marketable&rdquo; bringer of &lsquo;cool&rsquo; or &lsquo;cred.&rsquo; <br /><br /> Yet it is not adequate for music to be free of charge, or to self-sacrifice in the process.  <br /><br /> Why should this worker-of-a-different-kind barely live? In this era, the life-sacrifice of a cultural worker can only endorse the very structure of exploitation and de-humanization pushed into, forward, around and within the de-humanizing world of multinational capital. The capitalist accumulators have to starve musicians, writers and thinkers to survive, because if they did not, the entire fabric of culture would be different, less tolerant of US security and less afraid. To allow ourselves to be starved willingly, bolstered by the fantasy of the &lsquo;starving artist,&rsquo; is to collude with the plans of the agents of exploitation who right now stalk the globe with tanks and missiles. <br /><br />The anti-war demonstrators have broken a silence that has postured as US patriotism since September 11th. There are many silences to be broken. Silence breakers in the realm of the word, and in the structures of sound, are being starved, censored, and humiliated daily. Funding is steadily being cut off, intellectual projects are being gutted, major labels increasingly circulate more cheap-to-produce stock repetitions, recycled from backlogs of unpaid artist recordings, loading these de-skilling trances into the places most of us must traverse to eat, socialize and live. <br /><br /> The brutal mass murder taking place in the invasion of Iraq, strategic assassinations, reliance on unpaid domestic labour, the inability to provide the basic necessities of life (healthcare, adequate incomes and housing for all people) and the de-humanizing gestures of those who offer sexual desire, or approval, in return for free music, all these things are direct descendants of a multinational capitalist regime which does not hesitate to manipulate nationalism and national identity for its agenda. The very structures of this regime demand maximum labour while returning minimum, if any, subsistence to its subjects. In many cases it prefers to exterminate those whose labours it is not in a position to benefit from.

Years later, thanks to detective work by - naturally - Mr Clint Simonson of the De Stijl imprint, it turned out that not only was Askew still breathing but he had actually recorded a follow-up to his ESP disk in 1970 that had lain in the can for decades. Originally released as a limited vinyl edition by Simonson himself, Little Eyes blew even his revered ESP side to ribbons and stands as one of the most magical outsider/freak artefacts to ever escape the prodigious gravity of the decade in which it was birthed. Askew has a highly idiosyncratic vocal style that is equal parts quizzical bubble-gum chewing kind on shrooms and doe-eyed real people Richard Brautigan character. Perhaps the closest comparison would be to Tom Rapp or Judee Sill’s old buddy Tommy Peltier. His instrumental conceptions certainly owe a massive debt to Dylan circa 64/65 - who the fuck didn’t - especially his spine-tingling harmonica work but it’s the beautiful arc of the songs that will keep you coming back, the way he combines rough, fluffed performances with eye-watering lyrical sentiments, heartbreaking phrasing and weird, clunky chords played on a ‘Martin tiple’.

Summer 1987: Rubin Fiberglass crawls down to Isla Vista (a decaying beach town several miles outside Santa Barbara) from Santa Cruz and soon meets Grady Runyan. Both playing guitar and songwriting, the duo begat a fine meld of 60&rsquo;s/70&rsquo;s garage punk called the Umbilical Chords, guided as much by their originals as by the then-current wave of Aussie Stooge-necrophilia. In attendance at the Umbilical Chords shows is bassist/guitarist Scott Derr, late of the unheralded Squid Patrol.</p>\n<p>Fall &rsquo;88: Monoshock forms soon after the Umbilical Chords implode. The new band&rsquo;s m.o. was different though - based around simpler riffs and louder volume &ndash; not to mention the emerging trademark &ldquo;wall of wah&rdquo; guitar that Grady was coaxing from his Harmony Rocket (kinda like a massive, amplified &ldquo;whoosh&rdquo; of static getting sucked in and out of the room). Rubin Fiberglass switches over to drums with the big bottom supplied by Scott on bass. Suffice to say the air was turned to cottage cheese wherever these guys played, which was mostly carports, house parties and occasionally downtown Santa Barbara. It was Socal beach grunge, but lumberjacks don&rsquo;t play volleyball &ndash; in other words, no one was paying attention &ndash; but thankfully the band recorded itself for posterity. The tape was later circulated as a demo (&ldquo;Welcome To My Meat Market&rdquo;), but met with the same familiar indifference.</p>\n<p>Summer &rsquo;89 and Monoshock is history. Grady moves to the Bay Area to co-found the ear-splitting Liquorball (check out &ldquo;Hauls Ass&rdquo; and a couple of great singles), and later, as drummer, joins Cardinal Sin, an SF group who would play their own twisted psych-pop along the Barrett-Spence-Erickson axis for an under-appreciated decade. Back in I.V., Scott and Rubin form the infamous Early Man Site with Tommy &ldquo;Hon Lang&rdquo; Kruger, while Scott and Tommy begin to issue records as Blackjack. By early &lsquo;92, both Blackjack and EMS had likewise migrated northward. The band had incorporated fellow-I.V.-&eacute;migr&eacute; &ldquo;Shindig&rdquo; along the way and was now beguiling SF audiences with its twin-guitar carpet-rock. Following the Cardinal Sin/EMS Northwest tour (on which Monoshock played an impromptu gig in a Seattle basement&hellip;no you weren&rsquo;t there), Grady joins EMS as THIRD guitarist. How heavy is too heavy? EMS begins to unravel under its own weight.</p>\n<p>But the triangle remains unbroken: In March &rsquo;93, Monoshock MK2 arises from the EMS aftermath. Rubin, Grady and Scott rekindle the Asheton Bros. instrumental oomph, but with a greater fondness for &ldquo;out&rdquo; sounds and ideas. Within days, they are onstage playing a set of I.V.-era material from memory (there was no rehearsal), closing the show with a special guest Jeff/Cardinal Sin riding free-form tone generator over the proceedings. From here on, band activities were centered in Oakland (where all three were now living), and the woodshedding truly began: by the end of the year, Monoshock had an entirely new repertoire, as reflected in this collection and WTTF.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Twas around this time the band hooked up with the Insane Cat, two expatriate east-coasters moonlighting as a recording studio in an SF basement. The duo&rsquo;s artastic notions (part of the Trashart continuum - check out their Zappa-esque Ikagen LP from &rsquo;84), not to mention recreational habits, synched up with the band&rsquo;s own, and trips to the &ldquo;studio&rdquo; were too numerous to count during &rsquo;94-&rsquo;95: all of the band&rsquo;s singles, as well as WTTF, were recorded here during that time. The sympathetic atmosphere was crucial&hellip;..let&rsquo;s just say the band could really let its hair down at the &lsquo;Cat, and that the resulting hair loss bleeds through all these recordings, despite the aggressive non-fidelity.</p>\n<p>The bands&rsquo; pursuit of maximal sound was, among other things, a magnet for the musically unemployable. Both the troll-like Feast - who crashed shows on self-abusive tambourine - and Hawkman Doug Pearson (keys and electronics) became regularly random collaborators. But the void was ultimately filled by the enigmatic sound-slayer known as the Aluminum Queen (whose 8-track tapes of startling noise warrant their own reissue); initially commuting over an hour to play assault-sax on the closing numbers in the set, he eventually relocated to Oakland to become a functioning fourth member, adding Ping-style electrics and tapes to the bands&rsquo; intense clatter.</p>\n<p>And lest you get the impression that Monoshock were some sort of &ldquo;studio&rdquo; band, rest assured that these guys played out regularly during &rsquo;94-&rsquo;95, both in town and out (Chico, Santa Rosa, I.V.) - the band was very visible, though attendance was never what you&rsquo;d call SRO. They even embarked on two major tours that saw their sound uncorked all the way to Memphis and back. But the madness took its toll: by Fall &rsquo;95, when WTTF was ultimately completed, Monoshock was rapidly closing in on burn out.

Rother did contribute some guitar work on this album and his influence is greatly felt. <i>Zuckerzeit</i> sounds different from any other Cluster album, with clearly defined melody and beat and a very rhythmic sound, at times approaching the <a title=\"Motorik\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorik\" mce_href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorik\">Motorik</a> style of Neu!</p>\n<p>After the release of <i>Deluxe</i> Harmonia went back to the studio with a new fourth member: <a title=\"Brian Eno\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno\" mce_href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno\">Brian Eno</a>. Various websites quote Eno as saying that Harmonia was \"the world's most important rock band\" in the mid '70s, including Sherman Wick in his review of <i>Musik Von Harmonia</i>. Daniel Dumych, who also cites that quote, writes in his article for hyperreal.org: \"Perhaps Eno's reason for praising Harmonia so highly was that their music fit the requirements of ambient rock. Its music was equally suitable for active or passive listening. The careful listener found his/her attentions rewarded by the musical activities and sounds, but Harmonia's music was also capable of setting a sonic environment.\" Clearly Eno had been very impressed with both <i>Musik von Harmonia</i> and <i>Zuckerzeit</i> and had joined Harmonia on tour once, jamming with the group at The Fabrik in <a title=\"Hamburg\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg\" mce_href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg\">Hamburg</a>.

Zach, one of the most passionate dudes I know when it comes to music, made it his mission to track Higgins down after Chasny gave him a burn of the LP as a gift. Higgins' soulful acoustic opus Red Hash was born in 1973 after years of kicking around the NYC folk-rock club scene, backing up people like Gary U.S. Bonds, even playing with Simeon pre-his Silver Apples days. After an unfortunate pot bust, Higgins was sentenced to two and a half years in the pen, and as a direct result of that, a 40 hour recording session ensued in the time prior to his incarceration. One listen to \"Thicker Than a Smokey\" and you immediately are sucked into the world of someone who feels a last chance at getting his feelings down in his music, maybe forever. It's gorgeous, pure, ultra-personal stuff that I became immersed more and more in with each listen. Last year Zach excitedly told me \"I found him!\" He not only called every Gary Higgins in the phone books of Connecticut where he allegedly resided, but wrote to every Gary Higgins he could find in the country. Band members have been reconnected, Higgins made a quick one-song appearance during a recent Six Organs show at Tonic, and word is a full-fledged release show with members from the original band line-up is in the making. <a href=\"http://www.dragcity.com/\">Drag City</a> (the label which thankfully Zach has landed at) reissues the disc July 26th.

During his time with The Phantom Limbs (in which he was sometimes known as Hopeless), Loto Ball's visceral expression of existential distress laced with black comedy, along with the hyper-charged and unusual compositions of keyboardist Stevenson Sedgwick helped earn his band the honor of No. 1 Indie Rock Band in San Francisco (S.F. Bay Guardian Best of the Bay awards 2003) and the chance to record two albums with Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles record label. After 5 years and 220 performances with The Phantom Limbs, including 3 U.S. tours and 2 European tours, Loto Ball left the band in 2005 to move to Chicago and pursue other ventures. Loto Ball has spent his time in Chicago working with local artists on various projects, including founding an art gallery/music venue (Reversible Eye), collaborating on a 800 foot public mural (Bloomingdale Trail), working as personal masseuse for Mayor Daley, performing with puppets (Scary Toesies), working for as an activist for disability rights and quality of life issues, as well playing trumpet for a 30-person marching band (Mucca Pazza). Loto Ball created the Loto Ball Show in 2005.

Born in Paris, France and raised in California, Pierre started his New York musical career in power punk band the Morning Glories in the early 90s and went on to play with Melomane, Vic Chesnutt, and many others. Pierre began to supplement his income writing and recording made-to-order songs as wedding gifts. These wedding songs became the first joint project of Pierre and Hilary. After years of working with Pierre in his studio, singing backup vocals on his bands&rsquo; recordings and the occasional public performance, Pierre coaxed Hilary on-stage for a musical tour of Russia and Eastern Europe in the summer of 2006, during which Hilary learned to sing and play keyboard simultaneously. The Snow was born! <br /> A classically trained clarinetist and saxophone player, Dave Spinley joined the group as a key writer and arranger. Having played in punk rock, jazz, country and pop bands in New York City for more than ten years, Spinley was well-seasoned to deal with the cosmic unrest which became the subject of many of the songs on their first full-length cd, &ldquo;True Dirt.&rdquo; Also an exploration of spirituality from a non-religious perspective, the transforming of Downes&rsquo; and de Gaillande&rsquo;s relationship seemed to mesh with the spiritual seeking in many of the album&rsquo;s songs. Jazz bassist Chris Gustafson added his chops to the mix. <br /> Backed by a deft rhythm section, featuring Jeffrey Schaeffer on drums and Justin Hosek (who replaced Gustafson after the recording) on upright bass, The Snow has a serious backbone. Their influences are as diverse as their sound &ndash; having been described as distinctly as a post-apocalyptic French cabaret and Americana heard at a possessed carnival. The overall mood is of a sweet serenade taking occasional turns into a hall of mirrors. They have been likened to Fleetwood Mac sitting around the pool trading songs with M. Ward, Cat Power, and Iron and Wine, or a first date between Joni Mitchell and Tom Waits. Hear for yourself... <br />The band's first album was recorded and mixed at Trout Studios by acclaimed producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Apples in Stereo, Sean Lennon, Evan Dando, Sebadoh) and was released on Vermillion Music in February 2008.

In Kelley's words: &ldquo;Using renewable energy to offset the electricity I needed to power my guitar amps and my recording machines was a simple and effective way for me to do something about my impact on the environment. Green-e certifies that I am buying 100 percent renewable energy.
